## Challenges

As always, begin by downloading the start code ([exercise2.zip](exercise2.zip)). Add it to your repository and commit it as "Ex2: Started exercise 2". Then complete and commit each challenge below separately with a descriptive commit messages. Remember to comment your work.

1. Change the game to display the number of successful dodges in the game itself (use the `text()` function for this) with nice typography (e.g. use `textAlign()`, `textSize()`, etc.)
2. ~~Change the game so that the enemy changes size and speed by a set amount (use variables) each time you successfully dodge it, make sure you reset the size and speed of the enemy when the player loses~~ __CANCELLED BECAUSE I LEFT THIS CODE IN ALREADY LIKE AN IDIOT__
3. Change the visuals of the game using shapes and/or images, including changing the background, the enemy, and the player
4. Change the game to add at least one more new `if` statement that changes the game further (could be based on enemy and player positions, keyboard commands, mouse buttons, etc. and could change the graphics, speeds, positions, scores, etc.)
5. Change the game so that the player changes size and speed too, but by a __random amount__ after each successful dodge, the amount should be able to be positive or negative. Speed and size should never become less than zero, however.

Optional challenge: After doing all this, are you able to turn this into a mobile-friendly game? You'll have to replace the keyboard controls with touch controls and think about the aspect ratio.

## Grading

Grading for exercises will consider the following categories equally:

- __Runs__ and __implements the challenges required__
- Has __suitable commenting for all added/changed code__
- Includes a minimum of one initial commit of the template code, and at least __one commit message per challenge addressed__, all commits must have a __descriptive message__ prefixed with "Ex2"
- Uses __good naming__ for added variables
- Is __well structured__, with new code added in sensible places in sensible orders

Each element is equally weighted in your the grade for the exercise and will be graded as follows:

- __Excellent__ (A / 100%) - Meets requirements perfectly
- __Good__ (B / 75%) - Meets requirements with some minor issues
- __Adequate__ (C / 50%) - Meets requirements but with clear issues
- __Poor__ (D / 25%) - Barely meets requirements
- __Non-submission / Unacceptable__ (F / 0%)
